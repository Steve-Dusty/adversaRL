      - "add dramatic side lighting with strong shadows"
      - "create a sunset lighting effect with warm tones"

    occlusion:
      - "place a tall transparent glass in front of the object"
      - "add some clutter partially blocking the object"
      - "introduce a cardboard box edge obscuring part of the view"

    visual:
      - "desaturate the scene to near grayscale"
      - "change the object to match the table color closely"
      - "add visual noise and grain to the image"
      - "make the surface reflective and shiny"

    distraction:
      - "add colorful objects in the background"
      - "introduce movement in the peripheral view"
